Actors, Directors, Producers, Narrators, and Crew are all consider a Contributor. Popular recurring Characters such as Batman, Harry Potter, or Spider-man are also considered Contributors in Video Explore. ',l:''},'Credit \n':{d:'A credit lists the contribution of a person (or occasionally a company, such as a record label) to a recording. Generally, a credit consists of: \nThe name of the person or company.\nThe role the person played on the recording (an instrument played, or another role such as composer or producer).\nThe tracks affected by the contribution.\nA set of optional notes (such as “plays courtesy of Capitol records”). \nSee Role',l:''},'Features \n':{d:'Term used to encompass a particular media stream\u0027s characteristics and attributes; this is metadata and information accessed from processing a media stream. For example, when submitting an Album\u0027s Track, this includes information such as fingerprint, mood, and tempo metadata (Attributes).',l:''},'Fingerprint':{d:'A unique representation of a sample of audio that can be used to identify a track.',l:''},'Generation Criterion\n':{d:'A selection rule for determining which tracks to add to a playlist.',l:''},'Generator \n':{d:'Short for playlist generator. This is a term used to indicate that an artist has at least one of the extended metadata descriptors populated. The metadata may or may not be complete, and the artist text may or may not be locked or certified. See also: extended metadata, playlist optimized artist.',l:''},'Genre':{d:'A categorization of a musical composition characterized by a particular style.',l:''},'Link Module':{d:'A module available in the Desktop and Auto products that allows applications to access and present enriched content related to media that has been identified using  identification features.',l:''},'Manual Playlist':{d:'A manual playlist is a playlist that the user has created by manually selecting tracks and a play order. An auto-playlist is a playlist generated automatically by software. This distinction only describes the initial creation of the playlist; once created and saved, all that matters to the end-user is whether the playlist is static (and usually editable) or dynamic (and non-editable). All manual playlists are static; the track contents do not change unless the end-user edits the playlist. An auto-playlist may be static or dynamic. ',l:''},'Metadata':{d:'Data about data. For example, metadata such as the artist, title, and other information about a piece of digital audio such as a song recording.

See Sonic Attributes.',l:''},'More Like This ':{d:'A mechanism for quickly generating playlists from a user’s music collection based on their similarity to a designated seed track, album, or artist.',l:''},'Multiple Match ':{d:'During CD recognition, the case where a single TOC from a CD may have more than one exact match in the MDB. This is quite rare, but can happen. For example with CDs that have only one track, it is possible that two of these one-track CDs may have exactly the same length (the exact same number of frames). There is no way to resolve these cases automatically as there is no other information on the CD to distinguish between them. So the user must be presented with a dialog box to allow a choice between the alternatives. See also: frame, GN media database, TOC.',l:''},'MusicID Module':{d:'Enables MusicID recognition for identifying CDs, digital music files and streaming audio and delivers relevant metadata such as track titles, artist names, album names, and genres. Also provides library organization and direct lookup features.',l:''},'MusicID-File Module':{d:'A feature of the MusicID product that identifies digital music files using a combination of waveform analysis technology, text hints and/or text lookups.',l:''},'PCM (Pulse Coded Modulation)':{d:'Pulse Coded Modulation is the process of converting an analog in a sequence of digital numbers. The accuracy of conversion is directly affected by the sampling frequency and the bit-depth. The sampling frequency defines how often the current level of the audio signal is read and converted to a digital number. The bit-depth defines the size of the digital number. The higher the frequency and bit-depth, the more accurate the conversion.',l:''},'PCM Audio':{d:'PCM data generated from an audio signal.',l:''},'Playlist':{d:'A set of tracks from a user’s music collection, generated according to the criteria and limits defined by a playlist generator.',l:''},'Popularity':{d:'Popularity is a relative value indicating how often metadata for a track, album, artist and so on is accessed when compared to others of the same type. Gracenote’s statistical information about the popularity of an album or track, based on aggregate (non-user-specific) lookup history maintained by Gracenote servers. Note that there’s a slight difference between track popularity and album popularity statistics. Track popularity information identifies the most popular tracks on an album, based on text lookups. Album popularity identifies the most frequently looked up albums, either locally by the end-user, or globally across all Gracenote users. See Rating and Ranking',l:''},'Ranking ':{d:'For Playlist, ranking refers to any criteria used to order songs within a playlist. So a playlist definition (playlist generator) may rank songs in terms of rating values, or may rank in terms of some other field, such as last-played date, bit rate, etc. ',l:''},'Rating':{d:'Rating is a value assigned by a user for the songs in his or her collection. See Popularity and Ranking.',l:''},'Role':{d:'A role is the musical instrument a contributor plays on a recording. Roles can also be more general, such as composer, producer, or engineer. Gracenote has a specific list of supported roles, and these are broken into role categories, such as string instruments, brass instruments. See Credit.',l:''},'Seed Track, Disc, Artist, Genre ':{d:'Used by playlist definitions to generate a new playlist of songs that are related in some way, or similar, to a certain artist, album, or track.This is a term used to indicate that an artist has at least one of the extended metadata descriptors populated. The metadata may or may not be complete, and the artist text may or may not be locked or certified. See also: extended metadata, playlist optimized artist, playlist-related terms. ',l:''},'Sonic Attributes':{d:'The Gracenote Service provides two metadata fields that describe the sonic attributes of an audio track. These fields, mood and tempo, are track-level descriptors that capture the unique characteristics of a specific recording. Mood is a perceptual descriptor of a piece of music, using emotional terminology that a typical listener might use to describe the audio track. Tempo is a description of the overall perceived speed or pace of the music. The Gracenote mood and tempo descriptor systems include hierarchical categories of increasing granularity, from very broad parent categories to more specific child categories.',l:''},'Target Field':{d:'The track attribute used by a generation criterion for selecting tracks to include in a generated playlist.',l:''},'Tempo':{d:'Track-level descriptor of the overall perceived speed or pace of the music; includes hierarchical categories of increasing granularity.
