        <h2><a name="_Mood_Level_Arousal/Valance"></a><a name="kanchor187"></a>Navigating with Mood</h2>
        <p><a name="kanchor188"></a>This topic suggests some possible UI designs for mood-based playlists. The designs presented are suggestions only. The <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup #text #textPopup">Mood<span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"></span>Track-level perceptual descriptor of a piece of music, using emotional terminology that a typical listener might use to describe the audio track; includes hierarchical categories of increasing granularity. See Sonic Attributes.</span></a> APIs are flexible and can support most any type of UI that can be designed.  </p>
        <h3>Slider Navigation</h3>
        <p><a name="kanchor189"></a>Slider Mood Navigation is shown below. Gracenote recommends this design because of its simplicity and ease-of-use in an automotive environment. It can support a touch-screen or scroll-wheel interface for selecting values. This design provides the ability to choose five discrete values on each dimension of Valence and Arousal. </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/mood-slider.jpg" style="visibility: visible;width: 609px;height: 345px;" />
        </p>
        <h3>Grid Navigation</h3>
        <p>Grid navigation is shown below.&#160; It is similar to the slider design. However, mood selection is made across a two-dimensional grid of discrete mood values. With this design, the user can select 25 discrete values as cells on a two-dimensional grid of Valence/Arousal values. This design supports a touch-screen easily, but may be more difficult to map to a scroll-wheel interface. Grid navigation can implement a heat-map design to indicate the relative number of tracks matching each grid.&#160; For example, the more tracks there are in a cell, the darker the shade of the cell. In this example, the vertical axis corresponds to Valence values, and the horizontal axis corresponds to Arousal values. </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/mood-urgent_573x322.jpg" style="visibility: visible;width: 573;height: 322;" />
        </p>
        <h3>Bubble Magnitude Navigation</h3>
        <p>Bubble Magnitude navigation is shown below. This interface differs by using state bubbles to show the user what moods exist in the collection. Bubbles that are filled-in contain tracks for that mood. The size of the bubble indicates the relative number of tracks (the magnitude) in that mood category. This is similar to the heat-map design used in Grid navigation. </p>
        <p>The bubbles are placed in a Valence/Arousal grid to provide an intuitive way to select mood playlists. The implementation supports a touch screen easily, but may be more difficult to map to a scroll-wheel interface..</p>
        <p>The example below shows Bubble Magnitude navigation for the Level 2 set of 100 moods. This implementation is based on the Gracenote Habu mobile application for the iPad. Automotive applications should provide Level 1 moods (25 bubbles). As in the other implementations, selecting a bubble creates a playlist for the Valence/Arousal value. </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>

        </p>
        <h3>Other Mood Design Considerations</h3>
        <p>Whichever interface design you implement, your application should follow these guidelines when a user selects a mood.</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 18pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;" value="1"><a name="kanchor190"></a>Keep the Mood <a href="javascript:void(0);" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup #text #textPopup" style="list-style-type: disc;">Playlist<span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"></span>A set of tracks from a user’s music collection, generated according to the criteria and limits defined by a playlist generator.</span></a> Selector active so users can easily select different moods.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 18pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;" value="1"><a name="kanchor191"></a>When the user selects a new mood, go directly to the Selection Results Browser with the refreshed playlist.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 18pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;" value="1">After several seconds of Mood being active, go directly to Selection Results Browser and start playback of the tracks. This allows the user to activate Mood and continue to use the mood selection from the last time Mood was used.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In addition to the UI designs presented above, you can add other components to enhance the mood experience. Examples of these enhancements are: </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 18pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;" value="1"><a name="kanchor192"></a>Voice Commands:&#160; Mood playlist navigation by voice is a feature that can improve the automobile music listening experience.&#160; As a mood playlist is playing for instance, a user could speak More Positive or Less Dark to have the playlist automatically adjust to their tastes. All of the interfaces presented above could support a voice interface like this, but the Slider navigation interface visually maps more directly to these commands. </li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 18pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;" value="1"><a name="kanchor193"></a><a href="javascript:void(0);" class="MCTextPopup MCTextPopupHotSpot MCTextPopup_Open MCTextPopupHotSpot_ MCTextPopupHotSpot_Popup #text #textPopup" style="list-style-type: disc;">Genre<span class="MCTextPopupBody popupBody"><span class="MCTextPopupArrow"></span>A categorization of a musical composition characterized by a particular style.</span></a> Filtering:&#160; The Grid navigation interface can be further enhanced to include a genre filter button. This filter lets the user to refine mood playlist to specific genres. To keep the filter selection simple, limit the available genres to only those in the user’s collection. Your application can provide filters based on other track metadata as well, such as era and artist type.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 18pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;" value="1">100 Mood Option:&#160; Both Grid and Bubble Magnitude navigation interfaces can support Level 2 (100 moods). The Slider navigation interface can also support Level 2 using two dimensions of 10 buttons each. However, the Level 1 (25 mood) design is optimal for this interface.</li>
        </ul>
