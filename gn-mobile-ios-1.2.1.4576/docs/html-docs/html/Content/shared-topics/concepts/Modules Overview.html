        <h1><a name="kanchor9"></a>Modules Overview</h1>
        <p><a name="kanchor10"></a>GNSDK consists of several modules that support specific Gracenote
			products. The principal module required for all applications is the
			GNSDK Manager. Other modules are optional, depending on the functionality of
		the applications you develop and the products you license from Gracenote.</p>
        <p>The table below describes the primary modules provided by the GNSDK. The actual modules in your software package depends on your product and as specified in your
		Gracenote license agreement. The modules are listed alphabetically. </p>

                    <p>Main module used by all applications, as it contains APIs that provide functionality common to the other GNSDK libraries. As Manager operates as the command center for all of the GNSDK libraries, the other GNSDK libraries cannot function without it. Any applications using GNSDK must have APIs implemented from the GNSDK libraries that meet their feature requirements, as well as APIs from Manager. </p>

                    <p><a name="kanchor26"></a>Provides APIs to recognize music delivered as a continuous stream. It automatically manages buffering of streaming audio, and continuously fingerprints the audio stream. It does not retain these fingerprints for later re-use. If your application requires re-usable fingerprints, use MusicID or MusicID-File instead. After establishing an audio stream, the application can trigger an identification query at any time. For example, this action could be triggered on-demand by an end user pressing an "Identify" button provided by the application UI. The identification process identifies the buffered audio. Up to seven seconds of the most recent audio is buffered. If there is not enough audio buffered for identification, <MadCap:conditionalText data-mc-conditions="Default.ProdMobileAnyPlatform,Default.ProdEntourageAnyPlatform,Default.ProdDesktop">MusicID-Stream </MadCap:conditionalText> waits until enough audio is received. The identification process spawns a thread and completes asynchronously. The application can identify audio using Gracenote Service online database or a local database. The default behavior attempts a local database match. If this fails, the system attempts an online database match. </p>

Taste analyzes this collection of songs and listening history and produces a persona. The persona is an abstraction of Gracenote attributes of all songs within it and is an accurate and compact representation of an individual's listening preferences and habits. The information stored within a persona can then be used to generate any number of channels. Each channel describes clusters of songs appropriate for the persona. </p>
