For example with CDs that have only one track, it is possible that two of these one-track CDs may have exactly the same length (the exact same number of frames). There is no way to resolve these cases automatically as there is no other information on the CD to distinguish between them. So the user must be presented with a dialog box to allow a choice between the alternatives. See also: frame, GN media database, TOC.</div>

The accuracy of conversion is directly affected by the sampling frequency and the bit-depth. The sampling frequency defines how often the current level of the audio signal is read and converted to a digital number. The bit-depth defines the size of the digital number.

Gracenote’s statistical information about the popularity of an album or track, based on aggregate (non-user-specific) lookup history maintained by Gracenote servers. Note that there’s a slight difference between track popularity and album popularity statistics. Track popularity information identifies the most popular tracks on an album, based on text lookups. Album popularity identifies the most frequently looked up albums, either locally by the end-user, or globally across all Gracenote users. See Rating and Ranking</div>
